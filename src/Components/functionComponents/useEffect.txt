 Flow: First 5 Renders (over 5 seconds approx)
✅ Initial Render (count = 1)
Component mounts.

useEffect runs with count = 1.

Creates Interval-1 → runs every 1000ms → does setCount(1 + 1) → sets count = 2.

Timer starts ticking...

✅ Render 2 (count = 2)
After 1s, Interval-1 fires, calls setCount(2).

React re-renders with count = 2.

useEffect runs again because count changed.

Creates Interval-2, which does setCount(2 + 1) → sets count = 3.

Now 2 intervals are active (Interval-1, Interval-2).

✅ Render 3 (count = 3)
1s later, both Interval-1 and Interval-2 fire:

Interval-1 → setCount(2)

Interval-2 → setCount(3)

setCount(3) causes re-render (React skips re-render for same value like 2).

count becomes 3.

useEffect runs again.

Creates Interval-3, which does setCount(3 + 1) → sets count = 4.

Now 3 intervals are active.

✅ Render 4 (count = 4)
All three intervals run after 1s:

Interval-1 → setCount(2)

Interval-2 → setCount(3)

Interval-3 → setCount(4)

Only setCount(4) causes change → re-render.

count becomes 4.

useEffect runs again.

Creates Interval-4 → setCount(5)

Now 4 intervals are running.

✅ Render 5 (count = 5)
After another second, all 4 intervals fire:

Interval-1 → setCount(2)

Interval-2 → setCount(3)

Interval-3 → setCount(4)

Interval-4 → setCount(5)

setCount(5) triggers re-render → count = 5

useEffect runs again.

Creates Interval-5 → setCount(6)

Now 5 intervals are running in parallel.


Problem Timeline Example
Let’s say count = 2 currently, and you have multiple intervals running:

Time	Interval	Captured count	setCount(captured + 1)	Result
2s	    Interval-1	1	setCount(2)	❌ Skipped (already 2)
2s     Interval-2	2	setCount(3)	✅ Re-render with 3
3s	   Interval-1	1	setCount(2)	❌ Skipped again
3s	 Interval-2	2	setCount(3)	❌ Skipped again
3s	Interval-3	3	setCount(4)	✅ Count becomes 4



Analogy:
Imagine 3 workers trying to update the score on a scoreboard:

Worker A sees 1, adds 1 → sets it to 2

Worker B sees 2, adds 1 → sets it to 3

Worker C still sees 1 → tries to set it to 2 again

Even if the scoreboard ignores duplicate values, the workers are fighting — the flicker is from the conflicting attempts, not from successful renders.

Render #1 (Initial Mount):
count = 1

Component renders

useEffect runs:

Starts Interval A: every 1s → setCount(prev => prev + 1)

Registers cleanup: clearInterval(Interval A)

✅ Output on screen: 1

⏱️ After 1 Second → Interval A Fires:
setCount(prev => prev + 1) → count becomes 2

Component re-renders because state changed

🔁 Render #2:
count = 2

Component renders again

useEffect runs again (because [count] changed)

🔥 clearInterval(Interval A)

Starts Interval B

Registers cleanup: clearInterval(Interval B)

✅ Output on screen: 2

⏱️ After 1 More Second → Interval B Fires:
setCount(prev => prev + 1) → count = 3

Triggers a re-render

🔁 Render #3:
count = 3

useEffect runs again:

🔥 Clears Interval B

Starts Interval C

✅ Output: 3

⏱️ After 1 More Second → Interval C Fires:
setCount(prev => prev + 1) → count = 4

🔁 Render #4:
count = 4

useEffect runs again:

🔥 Clears Interval C

Starts Interval D

✅ Output: 4

⏱️ After 1 More Second → Interval D Fires:
setCount(prev => prev + 1) → count = 5

🔁 Render #5:
count = 5

useEffect runs:

🔥 Clears Interval D

Starts Interval E

✅ Output: 5

🔁 And so on...
Every second:

The interval adds +1 using the latest value

The effect tears down the old interval and starts a new one

It’s working correctly but less efficient than needed
